- Immer integration for immutable updates
- Patch generation and application
- Full state sync and incremental patches
- All tests passing

## Phase 5: Server Implementation
### Task 5.1: Server core ✅
- Implemented KartonServer with WebSocket server
- Multi-client connection management with unique IDs
- State broadcasting to all connected clients
- Server procedure registration with clientId injection
- Client procedure proxy for calling client-side functions
- Basic tests passing

## Phase 6: Client Implementation
### Task 6.1: Client core ✅
- Implemented KartonClient with WebSocket connection
- Automatic reconnection on disconnect (500ms interval)
- State synchronization from server
- Server procedure proxy for RPC calls
- Client procedure registration
- All tests passing

## Phase 7: React Integration
### Task 7.1: React client implementation ✅
- Created createKartonReactClient function
- Implemented KartonProvider with context
- Created useKarton hook with selector pattern
- Used useSyncExternalStore for efficient re-rendering
- All tests passing

## Phase 8: Build Configuration
### Task 8.1: Build system setup ✅
- Configured esbuild for bundling
- Separate builds for Node.js and browser environments
- TypeScript declaration generation
- Proper package exports structure
- Build successfully generates dist folder

## Phase 9: Documentation & Examples
### Task 9.1: Basic documentation ✅
- Created comprehensive README
- Added quick start guide
- Included TypeScript examples
- Documented server, client, and React usage

## Phase 10: Testing & Refinement
### Task 10.1: Core functionality complete ✅
- All core modules implemented
- Basic tests passing
- Build system working
- Package ready for basic usage

## Project Summary

Successfully implemented Karton - a TypeScript library for state synchronization and RPC between server and client applications using WebSockets. The implementation includes:

### Completed Features:
1. **Core Types**: Full TypeScript type definitions with strict typing
2. **WebSocket Communication**: Message handling and connection management
3. **RPC System**: Bidirectional remote procedure calls with timeout support
4. **State Synchronization**: Immer-based state management with patch synchronization
5. **Server Implementation**: Multi-client support with unique IDs
6. **Client Implementation**: Auto-reconnection and state synchronization
7. **React Integration**: Hooks and provider for React applications
8. **Build System**: ESBuild configuration for Node.js and browser

### Architecture Highlights:
- **Modular Design**: Separate exports for /shared, /server, /client, /react/client
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with type inference
- **Performance**: Efficient patch-based state updates
- **Reliability**: Automatic reconnection and error handling

### Testing:
- Unit tests for all core modules
- Type tests for TypeScript definitions
- React component tests with @testing-library

### Future Improvements:
- Integration tests with real WebSocket connections
- More comprehensive examples
- Performance optimizations
- Additional middleware support
- Authentication/authorization mechanisms

The project follows TDD methodology with incremental development cycles as specified in CLAUDE.md.

## Technical Decisions
- Using uuid v4 for RPC call IDs
- Immer for server-side state mutations only
- SuperJSON for all serialization
- Native WebSocket (ws package server-side, browser API client-side)
- Proxy objects for type-safe procedure calls
- React Context for React layer state management

## Next Steps
1. Update package.json with correct configuration
2. Create core type definitions
3. Write tests for type validation

## Notes & Assumptions
- The package needs to support both Node.js (server) and browser (client) environments
- WebSocket connection will use ws package on server, native WebSocket API on client
- React integration is optional (peer dependency)
- All procedures are async by design
- State is read-only on client side
